## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate a workflow for generating synthetic data, uploading it to a SQL database, and performing analysis using Power BI. Synthetic data generation is particularly useful in scenarios where real data may not be available or cannot be shared due to privacy concerns.

## Setup
To use the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLAlchemy
- Pandas
- Faker

You'll also need access to a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and Power BI Desktop.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-notebook.git
