# Project Notebook: solo_projects

Welcome to my personal project notebook on GitHub! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in Python, MySQL, and Power BI. It contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks designed to help me train and improve my skills by generating fake datasets, uploading them to a SQL database, and analyzing the data in Power BI. This README will guide you through the contents of the repository and how to effectively utilize these notebooks for learning and skill development

## Introduction
This project aims to demonstrate a workflow for generating synthetic data, uploading it to a SQL database, and performing analysis using Power BI. Synthetic data generation is particularly useful in scenarios where real data may not be available or cannot be shared due to privacy concerns.

## Setup
To use the notebooks in this repository, you'll need to have the following prerequisites installed:
- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLAlchemy
- Pandas
- Faker

You'll also need access to a SQL database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and Power BI Desktop.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/khangsheng1/solo_projects


2. Install the required Python dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook server:

jupyter notebook


4. Navigate to the notebook you wish to run and execute the cells as instructed.

5. Once you have generated the fake data and uploaded it to your SQL database, you can connect to the database using Power BI and perform analysis.

## Notebook Descriptions
- **PetNames.ipynb**: This notebook serves as an introduction to Python and SQL. It demonstrates how to generate fake pet names and upload them to an SQL database.
- **MockPatients.ipynb**: This project generates fake patient data for a fictional small town in Arkansas. It simulates encounters and billing cycles for these mock patients, generating fake encounters and billing them at regular intervals.
